<h2>Description</h2>
<p>You thought you've tried it all. You traveled the world, ate locally unheard 
    of cuisine in the most exotic environments. You met the 
    highest praised chefs in the world, and even impressed a few. 
    You thought you had done it all, but you were wrong.<br>
    There was just one thing you were missing - Milk Steak.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 medium 8.8oz. (.25Kg) flat iron steak (top blade shoulder steak)</li>
    <li>2 cup milk (preferably whole, called "4%")</li>
    <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>(Optional Garnish) 1/2 cup Jelly BellyÂ® jelly beans</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add milk, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to a medium sized saucepan if you have one. <br>If you do not have a saucepan, then any large concave metal object will work, such as a trashcan lid.</li>
    <li>Heat up the mixture, stirring until the honey has completely dissolved.</li>
    <li>Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
    <li>Carefully place the steak int he boiling milk mixture.</li>
    <li>Bring the liquid back to a boil and reduce the heat so the milk is simmering.</li>
    <li>Cook steak for five minutes on one side, stirring the top occasionally to stop a skin from forming ont he milk.</li>
    <li>Turn the steak over and cook for a further five minutes.</li>
    <li>Check how well cooked your steak is. For authenticity, the steak should be cooked "over hard," therefore having no pink at all.</li>
    <li>Allow Steak to res for a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Garnish with jelly beans and serve!</li>
</ol>
